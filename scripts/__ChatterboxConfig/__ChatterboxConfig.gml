// Direction mode controls how <<directions>> are processed by Chatterbox
// There are three possible values:
// 
// CHATTERBOX_DIRECTION_MODE = 0
// This is the officially recommended behaviour. The full contents of the direction (everything
// between << and >>) are passed as a string to a function for parsing and execution by the
// developer (you). I think this behaviour is stupid but I've included it here because technically
// that is what the YarnScript specification says. You can set the function that receives the
// direction string by setting CHATTERBOX_DIRECTION_FUNCTION. Exactly what syntax you use for
// directions is therefore completely up to you.
// 
// CHATTERBOX_DIRECTION_MODE = 1
// Chatterbox will treat directions as expressions to be executed in a similar manner to in-line
// expressions. This is covenient if you want to treat directions as little snippets of code
// that Chatterbox can run. Syntax for directions becomes the same as in-line expressions, which
// is broadly similar to "standard" GML syntax. Functions that you wish to execute must be added
// by calling ChatterboxAddFunction().
// 
// An example would be: <<giveItem("amulet", 1)>>
// 
// 
// CHATTERBOX_DIRECTION_MODE = 2
// Chatterbox will treat directions as expressions with a greatly simplified syntax. This is
// useful for writers and narrative designers who are less familiar with the particulars of
// coding and instead want to use a simple syntax to communicate with the underlying GameMaker
// application. The direction is sliced into arguments using spaces as delimiters. The first
// token in the direction is the name of the function call, as added by ChatterboxAddFunction().
// Subsequent tokens are passed to the function call with each token being a function parameter.
// All parameters are passed as strings. If a parameter needs to contain a space then you may
// enclose the string in " double quote marks.
// 
// An example, analogous to the example above, would be: <<giveItem amulet 1>>
