Chatterbox is a GameMaker implementation of the [Yarn language](https://yarnspinner.dev/), used in games such as [Far From Noise](https://www.georgebatchelor.com/farfromnoise), [Knights and Bikes](https://foamswordgames.com/#knights), and [Night In The Woods](http://www.nightinthewoods.com/).

Yarn is designed to be accessible to writers who have little or no programming knowledge. It makes no assumptions about how your game presents dialogue to the player, or about how the player chooses their responses. Syntax and features specific to Chatterbox can be found in the [documentation](http://jujuadams.github.io/Chatterbox). Chatterbox attempts to be a full implementation of the Yarn specification; if there's anything missing, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Chatterbox/issues) and Juju will do his best to meet your request.

Yarn files can be written by hand, but the best way to start with Yarn is to use an editor. The standard Yarn Editor tool is available on [Windows and MacOS](https://github.com/FaultyFunctions/Crochet/releases/), or as a [web-based editor](https://faultyfunctions.github.io/Crochet/).
